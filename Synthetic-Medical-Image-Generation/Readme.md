## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The VQ-VAE model successfully generated synthetic 2D medical images from random latent vectors.
*   The average Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between a subset of real images and the VQ-VAE generated images was 0.0663, indicating limited structural similarity.
*   The simplified StyleGAN model achieved a higher average SSIM score (0.1414) compared to the VQ-VAE model (0.0663), suggesting better structural similarity to real images.
*   Visually, StyleGAN generated images appeared clearer with more discernible structures and less distortion than the VQ-VAE generated images, which were blockier and less defined.
*   Generating high-quality 3D medical images is considered not immediately feasible with the current dataset (2D slices) and computational resources due to significantly larger data sizes, more complex 3D model architectures, and substantially higher computational demands.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   Future efforts should focus on obtaining a dataset of actual 3D medical volumes and securing access to more powerful computational resources to effectively train complex 3D generative models.
*   Explore alternative approaches for medical image synthesis, such as 2.5D methods that leverage information from adjacent slices or transfer learning from models pre-trained on large natural image datasets, as potentially more feasible steps with current resources.
